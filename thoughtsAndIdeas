Initial plan:
  dragon heist into a curse of stahd type game (use the Guide to ravenloft make a dread domain?!?!?!)
  
  Dragon heist:
    establish base of operations
    lots of room for NPC's  to meet and greet (allies and enemies)
    resources and up to level 4-5 by time we get to other plane
    way to get everyone aquanted and characters to form bonds together
    Bad guy?:
      carnival boat guy?
    Xanathar? X
    Black Market guy? X
    rich bitches X
    
    Connection:
    Maybe big bad tries to fee and so they end up in dread domain?
    Maybe volo or other NPC asks for help, lost love one, research for volo book?
    friend gone mad leads them in?
      As they defeat carnival guy, the plane of the carnival shifts dread domain?

    
  Dread domain:
    chrismas/cold icy theme?
    gothic horror?
    nautical/tropical?
    edge of war?
    
    lovable but hurt bad guy that you understand why he went that way but has gone to far dark now
    
    Starting with Dragon Heist so time to think of it
